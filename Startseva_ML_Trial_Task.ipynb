We came to the consensus that we need to do better in terms of performance. Sally brought doughnuts, which lightened the mood. It's important to make good use of what we have at our disposal. During the coffee break, we talked about the upcoming company picnic. We should aim to be more efficient and look for ways to be more creative in our daily tasks. Growth is essential for our future, but equally important is building strong relationships with our team members. As a reminder, the annual staff survey is due next Friday. Lastly, we agreed that we must take time to look over our plans carefully and consider all angles before moving forward. On a side note, David mentioned that his cat is recovering well from surgery.\n"

When this value is reduced even by a small degree, the result of the function changes significantly: the library makes mistakes, mistaking articles for words with a large semantic load and replaces them with suggested phrases that have a completely different meaning and are not suitable in this particular situation. Also, the library makes a big mistake and replaces words with a parameter less than 0.65 that have completely different meanings;\n",
        "*   **Cosine similarity** does not solve the problem of natural language in text data, i.e. synonyms and polysemy. This has a big impact on the accuracy of the search. At first glance, this method gives the same answer as the basic spacy library, but the result of accuracy (the confidence of the model in the result) may differ for the better by a very small fraction of one\n",

In such a model, it is possible to implement the division of text into semantic phrases according to the vocabulary of the language in order to exclude the occurrence of article substitutions. The model will also be able to learn from hundreds of similar phrases in order to learn how to see the context and eliminate lexical, grammatical and semantic errors.\n",
